This project is a smart irrigation system developed as part of the Wearable Computing course at VIT Vellore. It uses an Arduino Uno, soil moisture sensor, and a water pump to automatically water plants only when necessary. 
The goal is to conserve water and ensure optimal plant health with minimal human intervention.

Project Summary:
Manual plant watering can be inconsistent and inefficient, especially for people with busy lifestyles. 
This system continuously monitors soil moisture and activates the water pump only when the soil is dry, ensuring that plants are watered only when required.
 1.Hardware Components Used:

Arduino Uno
Soil Moisture Sensor
5V Relay Module
Water Pump & Tubing
Jumper Wires

2. How It Works:
The soil moisture sensor detects moisture levels in the soil.
If the soil is dry, it signals the Arduino.
The Arduino activates the relay, turning on the water pump.
Once moisture reaches a sufficient level, the system turns the pump off.

3. Results & Advantages:
Fully automated watering system
Reduces water wastage
Cost-effective and easy to build
Scalable for larger gardens
